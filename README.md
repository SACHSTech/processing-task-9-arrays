# Processing Task 7 - Arrays

## Learning Objectives
In this task, you will learn about defining arrays to animate a collection of objects.



## Step 1 - Lesson
Acquire the learning objectives by reviewing [this page in happycoding.io](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/processing/arrays)

## Step 2 - Task
Demonstrate your learning objectives by implementing the following:
  
### Level 2
Create a sketch that simulates snow falling. When the up arrow is pressed on the keyboard, the snow falls faster.  Likewise, the snow falls slower when the down arrow is pressed.
  
### Level 3
Enhance the level 2 sketch such that snow piles up on the ground as it hits the bottom of the screen.  HINT:  you will need an additional array with a length that is the width of the screen.  Use this array to track that height of the snow as it falls at the particular x position on the ground (see video in assignent post).
  
### Level 4
Enhance the level 3 sketch such that a trail of floating snowballs follows the mouse position.  The trail should decrease in size further away from the mouse cursor.  HINT: store the previous 25 positions of the mouse in an array and draw those to the screen! Check [this page](https://processing.org/tutorials/arrays) for more clues.
